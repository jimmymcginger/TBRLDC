SFX: 
Enemy arrives?
Enemy dies
Move from room to room
end of battle


Stuff:
Programme enemy attacks
then maybe make like.. characters classes? and try feeding in moves instead of a hardcoded list

Attacks that slow
Battle menu could have a "memory" setting so it remembers where you were in a menu
^ toggable in options



BATTLELOG 
SHould it loop (if it does, start/end should have a marker?)
Should it reset? Should we have some kind of marker system to easily find entries?
Colour/font changes for things like enemy name/ player names/ crits/ misses?

holding tab should show battle log, pressing up and down would scroll it. Needs to have arrows. < toggle for it be held or pressed
Turn order also needs arrows, could scroll that with some other letters

Note: eventually the bars for turn order could have a bar, which ffx has, based on inititive



end of battle - loot, you win message
character KO
make the turnorder longer and make it scrollable
^ maybe when you scroll this you can also see the combat log? and scroll that? 

Combat:
Reviving (when we do, change death_text_done back to false. will have to do same for any SFX/VFX)

let the fade finish when you finish a fight
and arrow needs to show when the battlelog text is ready to skip

animation between floors to show how far down you are
